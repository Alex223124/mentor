##### 1. Semantic Versioning

[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) is a method of adding a consistent and constant release to your software.

Things to improve in my code / release management:

- more documentation for public API
- correct version number, e.g. for git tags
  - x.y.z-alpha (x-major, y-minor, z-patch)
  - z only for bugfixes
