##### Basic Tech Stack

The main tools for Web Design are:
- Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) for semantically arranging content which users request and view with their Web Browser
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for adding styles to display the content in different ways: layout, typography, colors

-

##### Enhanced Tech Stack

Additional tools I prefer when developing for the Web usually with Ruby on Rails are:
- Sassy Sass (SASS) for the best readability
- HAML or Slim for the best readability
- Twitter Bootstrap for rapid prototyping or just its nice features

-

##### Style Guide

Create a Style Guide for each app.
Have a template of each relevant element and class with sample text.
